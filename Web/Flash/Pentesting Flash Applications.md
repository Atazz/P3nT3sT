# Main Areas to check
The following is a brief walkthrough of the security checks to perform when you encounter a flash component on a website.
- Client-side components (SWF files and container page)
- The communication protocol between the client side player and the server-side components
- Server-side components

# Static analysis of the SWF source code
## Analysis of the container page (Generally the HTML page containing the flash SWF file)
- Obtain the source code of the SWF files and search for interesting hard-coded information (URL, creds, etc.)
- Check if input parameters are sanitized
- Check the allowScriptAccess parameter
- check if input arguments that will be passed to the Flash are sanitized
- check if the policy file (crossdomain.xml) is configured properly

# Check for common vulnerabilities
- Check XSS
- Check HTML injections
- Check if input is not sanitized
-- You cound use SMFinvestigator for this. And decompile the file.

# Identifying Communication Protocol
A complex Flash application may make use of web services. so, each request could be sent according to a given protocol:
- SOAP
- AMF

This step is fundamental because it allows you to define the structure of the requests (Including your payloads) that you need to use to check server-side components.

# Analyzing Server Side Components
In order to enumerate all backend functions (services), we have to test each of them against common server-side vulnerabilities (SQL injections, Remote File Inclusions [RFI])
