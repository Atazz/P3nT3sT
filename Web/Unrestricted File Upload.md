# Unrestricted File Upload
The unrestricted File Upload vulnerablity is one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities that a web app may suffer. 

The vuln afftes all those web apps that allow the upload of files without properly enforcing restrictive policies on:
- The maximum size of the file (DOS)
- The nature of the file (if Image is PDF, XLS, TXT)

If web apps do not implement proper restrictions on files uploaded by the user, the risks of being compromised is very high.
